This course covers everything needed to pass the exam. But you may not find it as much interactive as you can expect, as it has lengthy slides to cover most of the topics. The course has the following two sections.\nAndroid \u0026amp; Mobile App Pen testing iOS \u0026amp; Mobile App Pen testing I also went through the TCM Security Mobile Application course for the preparation of this exam.\nExam Info Once you start the exam, you will be given with two android mobile applications with the letter of engagement. This engagement letter outlines the objectives you need to meet to pass the exam. The requirement to pass the exam is to provide a working android mobile application which can exploit both the given applications.\nTimeline I started the exam on 18th May, and I was able to identify the vulnerabilities in the first hour. I spent the first day on analysing the working of both the applications and exploiting these through CLI. The second day I started learning android studio and built a few test android applications. The next day, I built my exploit application which was able to exploit both the given application to perform the required tasks. I tested the built application on different emulators with different API versions as well as on my own mobile phone.\nExam Review The exam was not that much difficult as I was expecting. It was all about understanding the working of the application by reverse engineering it, retrieving data from the application using the provided functionalities and reconstructing another application by reversing the process. By reversing I mean, in some phases you will encounter different situation e.g. encryption, where you will have to reverse the same process to decrypt the given data. In the exam, you will not be asked to get a flag or to root any system, in fact you will get the answers in front of you within a few minutes. The requirement to pass the exam is to provide an application which can exploit those vulnerabilities automatically.\nTips for the Exam: Test the applications on at least one rooted and one non rooted emulator and observe the applications. Understand how Encryption and Hashing can be performed in android applications. Understand Content Providers in android and how these can be exploited. Learn how to build mobile applications with android studio. Learn to analyse the AndroidMenifest.xml file. I wish you the best of luck on your mobile application penetration testing journey.

No Link to purchase Here Exam Focused Areas Pivoting, Buffer Overflows My Experience: I started the eCPPT exam in the morning of 25th February 2024, uploaded report on 7th march at 1PM and got the email with subject \u0026ldquo;You are now an eCPPTv2!\u0026rdquo; on 27th March 2024.\nAs I prepared with the INE official course material, so before talking about the exam, I would like to talk about the course material.\nThe course covers all the skills needed to pass the eCPPT exam. However, I would say the course has over loaded information, which personally I skipped a lot. It is beneficial for the beginner to understand the concept but that\u0026rsquo;s going to take lot of time. In some places, you will find outdated information in the course, as the course is a little bit older (Thanks to INE that in April they will release new course material for eCPPT). So, Can we see eCPPT V3 soon?\nThe VPN Issue When I started the exam, the VPN was not working. It was giving the following error:\nReducted... failed to negotiate cipher with server Reducted... In the given openvpn configuration file:\nThe following line was there:\ncipher AES-128-CBC The above line was changed as\ndata-ciphers AES-128-CBC This fixed the issues. Further details about the issue can be found here here.\nPreparation: I started the exam on 25 February and submitted the report on 7th march 2024. It took me 12 days to submit the report, because I was also attending my university classes during this time. If you give full time to it, you may finish it earlier. I received the result after a long wait on 27 March 2024. INE has to work to reduce the exam result time. INE should also reduce the long 14 days time of the exam. The reason I have not attempted it for 1 year was lack of time, because I was always busy with work and studies that I was unable to take 15 days break from all that.\nTimeline Day1: In the first day, I was able to pwn one machine. It was very easy and I was happy and confident.\nDay2: I faced issues in setting the pivoting and proxychains during this day, and by the end of the day I was only able to verify that I set up pivoting the right way and all my tools started working again in this environment.\nDay3: I pawned the second machine fairly easily. I tried all what I can to pwn the 3rd machine but I failed, I was thinking it very complex but it was very simple, just lack of post exploitation enumeration.\nDay4: In the first half, I stuck again and at this point, I started worrying. But when I enumerated with focus then I found that I was missing a very simple thing, it was not needing anything extra. I rooted the 3rd machine and also worked on the 4rth one, which was the buffer overflow one.\nDay5: I managed to generate a working exploit for the buffer overflow machine. Note that, whenever you send a long input, the backend application will crash and buffer overflow machine will become unresponsive, you will need to reset the whole exam environment to make it responsive again, in this case make sure to use this tag while generating payload from the msfvenom EXITFUNC=thread. On the same day, I exploited the 5th and last machine as well.\nReporting It is the most important part of the exam. You will not get passing marks if you only show the ways of getting root access across all the machines, but you have to report all the vulnerabilities in each of the machine. I used TCM security report template, which I found to be more beneficial than others. My report was 130 pages long. I have not taken and saved screenshots during the exam, because I started recording using OBS at the start of the exam and saved all the recording with me. I went through all the videos later while preparing the report and took screenshot of the part in the video to add in the report.\nTips for the exam: Work on the pivoting before going to attempt the exam, it is mandatory. Practice the buffer overflows in the windows environment. Get your hands dirty on Metasploit. Specially the post exploitation and routing. Enumerate well in the post exploitation phase. Instead of making screenshot of everything, use OBS to record screen while working. You can use those recorded videos to make screen shots later while reporting.

So I used burp to encode it as shown below.\nWhen we double encode it: file_get_contents('flag.txt');, it will be very longer. So instead I double encoded just the g word in flag.txt.\nSo the final payload is:\ncmd=echo file_get_contents(\u0026#39;fla%25%36%37.txt\u0026#39;); So I run it, it gave me the flag.txt as show below.\nI hope you liked it. :)😍\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/ctf-writeups/bypass-square-web-nascon23/","summary":"In this challenge, we have to bypass two preg_match functions to get the flag.\nThe Given Code \u0026lt;?php #read flag.txt highlight_file(__FILE__); $code = $_GET[\u0026#39;cmd\u0026#39;]; $blocked_functions = \u0026#39;/(exec|shell_exec|system|`)/i\u0026#39;; if (preg_match($blocked_functions, $code)) { die(\u0026#34;Hacking attempt detected\u0026#34;); } else { $blocked_functions = \u0026#34;/flag/i\u0026#34;; if (preg_match($blocked_functions, $code)) { die(\u0026#34;Hacking attempt detected\u0026#34;); } else{ eval(urldecode($code)); } } ?\u0026gt; Initially, It highlights the code file.

The password of andre is exposed here. This password is being tried to ssh into the machine but it gave me that the password is incorrect.\nSo, the credentials are being tried at the Gila CMS admin login page. It worked and the admin page is being accessed.\nHere under content\u0026gt;file manager there is an option to upload file. A php reverse shell is being upload here. There\u0026rsquo;s no restriction on file upload.\nThe uploaded file can be accessed in the cmess.thm/assets/revshell.php.\nA reverse shell is being obtained as show below:\nRev shell obtained\nPrivilege Escalation Currently, we are in the machine as www-data user. The linenum.sh is being transferred to the machine and is being run. It gave us a password backup file as shown.\nEscalated to the user andre by running su andre , followed by the found password. As the current shell is not stable, we already got the password of andre, so connected to ssh with the credentials.\nThe user andre is being accessed as shown below:\nGot user access.\nFor getting root, the machine is being explored as the user andre.\nThere is a cronjob running, which is running after each 2 minutes and using wildcard with tar, it can used for getting root.\nThe following command is being run which will create a script that will copy the shell to the temp and will enable its suid bit.\necho \u0026#39;cp /bin/bash /tmp/bash; chmod +s /tmp/bash\u0026#39; \u0026gt; /home/andre/backup/runme.sh A checkpoint file is being created in the folder that will be backed up:\ntouch /home/andre/backup/--checkpoint=1 The following command will execute the script that is copying the shell to /tmp as root.\ntouch /home/andre/backup/--checkpoint-action=exec=sh\\ runme.sh Waited 2 minutes for the script to be executed,, and run the run the copied shell with command /tmp/bash -p\nThe machine is being rooted.\nIn this way, the root access is being obtained.\nConclusion The difficulty level of the machine was medium. The machine contains exposed password of user andre which can be used to access the admin panel. The admin panel has no restriction on file upload, and the files on the server can be run directly. For the privilege escalation, the machine again has exposed password of the user andre, which can be used for accessing the adre user from www-data. The root user can obtained by abusing the cronjobs.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/machine-writeups/cmess-tryhackme/","summary":"Setup The following entry is being added to the /etc/hosts.\n10.10.57.136 cmess.thm Enumeration Nmap all ports scan is being run.

All the requests were giving 403 forbidden response except the last one, which gave 200 OK response.\nI sent it HTTP Stream as shown below. In response there was data, which i didn\u0026rsquo;t understand initially.\nWhen i dig further then i got another message, which was giving us a hint that the previous data possibly encrypted with RC4 algorithm. But for that we need a key, and we do not have key yet.\nWhen i further analyzed the same http data, there was another message, which gave us the key. It was sending request to /f.php with different values for the get parameter t. When i combined the parameters values, it was secret which might be the key.\nSo now its time to put everything together and try it. I opened cyberchef and chose the RC4 algorithm. I put all the found info as shown below.\nI didn\u0026rsquo;t work :). The data we copied from the Wireshark was in ASCII format, which was the mistake. ASCII has limitations in representing characters beyond the basic Latin alphabet. So it is possible that data includes characters from different character sets (e.g., UTF-8). So, i chose RAW format from the Wireshark as shown below.\nNow, i copied the data in last line, as which is the data in response.\nThis time, i used the RAW format data in cyberchef, which worked as shown.\nHope you liked it.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/ctf-writeups/warmy-networksecurity-cyberhackathon23/","summary":"A pcap file was being given for analysis.\nThe pcap file was being opened in the wireshark.\nI applied the http filter to filter only http requests.\nThere was a zip file that was retrieved through http protocol.

Yes Link to purchase Here Cost Back in November 2022, during the Cyber Monday deal, I purchased the exam voucher for a cost of $150.\nPreparation Since I am in my final year of BS Cybersecurity, I have already obtained a solid understanding of many general concepts. Therefore, I have not enrolled in any additional courses.\nScheduling To schedule the exam, it is required to do so through the Aspen dashboard at least one month in advance.\nExam Day Review In preparation for the exam scheduled at 11 PM, I prioritized getting sufficient rest during the day to ensure a fresh and focused mind. As the exam process began through my dashboard at the designated time, I was prompted with a GoToMeeting link. Realizing I did not have the application installed, I proceeded to download it. To avoid similar issues, I recommend downloading the GoToMeeting application prior to starting the exam. After waiting for approximately 15 minutes with no response, I suspected the proctor may have missed the meeting and reached out to EC Council\u0026rsquo;s live support team. They provided me with an alternative link where the proctor was already waiting. If you experience a similar delay and your proctor has not joined the meeting after 10 to 15 minutes, I advise reaching out to the support team for assistance.\nBefore the exam, the proctor instructed me to enable my microphone, camera, and screen sharing. After following his instructions, he then asked me to show my surroundings to ensure no one was present to provide assistance. Once that was confirmed, he provided all the necessary information to start the exam.\nThe exam consisted of 20 questions and required the use of two browser based machines, a Windows and a Parrot machine.\nInitially, I focused on tasks that were focused on Parrot OS, I discovered all the hosts in the network and did enumeration of all the discovered hosts.\nI shifted to tasks that we can do with Windows after doing all the Linux based tasks. All the questions were very easy.\nThe questions were something like,\nWhat is the ftp password of John? What is the version of SSH? How many Windows machines are there? What is machine IP of windows machine running RDP? The windows based tasks were related to using cryptography, hashing and steganography tools etc. Tools If you want to do preparation for the CEH practical exam, you will need to be proficient in the following tools.\nnmap wireshark John the ripper Cryptool BCTextEditor Veracrypt Openstego Snow Hydra xfreerdp etc Conclusion The certification exam is beginner friendly. If you have the basic understanding of how to use different tools, you can pass the exam easily.\nThank you for taking the time to read this blog. I hope you found it informative and enjoyable.
