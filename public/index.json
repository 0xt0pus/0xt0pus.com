No Link to Purchase Here Exam Focused Areas Red Teaming, Active Directory, MDI Bypass Packages Training is included with the certification exam. There are different packages depending on the lab access time and type of training. There are two types of training that can be followed.\nBootcamps: These are the instructor led bootcamps for 4 week. In this training, you can interact with the instructor and can follow along. On Demand: This is the self paced training, where the recordings of the previous bootcamp session will be provided as the training videos. You can watch those videos on your own at any time. For more information about different packages check the purchase option on the following link: https://www.alteredsecurity.com/adlab\nMy Experience with the Course I chose the on-demand course with 30 days of lab access. I found the videos a bit lengthy compared to other courses I\u0026rsquo;ve taken. There\u0026rsquo;s no LMS system; instead, you\u0026rsquo;ll be provided with a Google Drive link to the videos. This is because, rather than focusing on the LMS platform, they have prioritized the quality of the training. The learning from those lengthy videos is simply amazing. Nikhil Mittal is a well-known figure in AD Security. He not only teaches the topic but also shares insights on whether an attack would be detected, what type of logging or security solution would catch a specific attack, and how to bypass those security measures. He also shares his experiences related to those attacks.\nIn the course, the instructor first teaches the theory and then demonstrates how to solve the lab on their platform for the related topic. A great aspect is that you get lifetime access to the course material, which remains accessible even after the exam.\nMy Experience with the Labs In the lab, you will be given access to a student VM, which is a part of AD enviroment with multiple machines and forests. You need to apply what you\u0026rsquo;ve learned to access these machines in different ways.\nThe mistake I made was trying to do both the lab and the course simultaneously. Before starting the course, I began my lab timer, which was limited to 30 days. While progressing through the course, I completed a few of the initial labs. However, I then decided to focus on finishing the course first. Due to my busy schedule, I completed the course but couldn\u0026rsquo;t finish all the labs in time. So, I recommend finishing the course at least once before starting the lab timer.\nFortunately, the lab manual with detailed commands, results, and walkthroughs was available even after the 30-day lab period expired, which was a great help. I used these resources to go through all the lab topics.\nExam Environment In the exam, you are given a student user account on a machine with low-level access. The goal of the exam is to achieve OS Command injection on five servers. The names of all the servers will be provided to you once you start the certification exam. There are unlimited restarts available, so you can restart any machine at any time. Make use of this often, as sometimes things start working after a machine is restarted.\nYou also have two chances to reset the entire exam environment, which will reset all the machines and provide you with fresh network instance, including the VPN configuration. I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t recommend using this option unless you’ve encountered a serious issue, as the reset process takes 20-25 minutes, which would waste valuable time. Instead, use the quick restart option whenever possible.\nMy Experience with the Exam I started the exam in the morning, with hope that I could access all the machines by evening or bedtime. However, I was mistaken, as it took me a full 25 hours. I was extremely tired after 25 sleepless hours.\nThe first issue I encountered was bypassing the MDI. All my scripts were getting blocked since it was a fully patched Windows environment. I realized my mistake after some time and followed the process taught in the course to handle this.\nNext, my goal was to gain elevated privileges on my own machine, which I managed to do quickly. I then found the vulnerability for the first target quickly but got stuck trying to find the correct way to exploit it. Follow the tips I’ve shared below to avoid this issue.\nThe second machine was easy, and I gained access very quickly. The third machine was very confusing for me and took more than 10-12 hours. This one requires some additional research, as I couldn’t get around it using the methods taught in the course. Eventually, I found a way to bypass it.\nThe fourth machine was also straightforward, and I completed it quickly. The fifth and final machine required accessing a machine in another domain. This was also easy when I followed the process taught in the course.\nReporting Once the exam time ended, I had 48 hours to submit the report. After the exam, the first thing I did was get some much-needed sleep. Then, I worked on the report slowly and finished it the next day. I emailed the report and, five days later, received an email starting with, \u0026lsquo;Congratulations! You have cleared the examination! You are now a Certified Red Team Professional.\u0026rsquo;\nTips for the Exam Try to have different Mimikatz versions (exe,ps1 \u0026amp; etc ), if one does not work, use the second one. Always run Mimikatz with NT Authority System level access. It will throw errors sometimes even if you are administrator or in the administrator group. So always have NT Authority System level access and then run it. If Mimikatz.ps1 gives error of 64 bit compatibility, use mimikatz.exe. Always try to run Rubeus.exe on cmd.exe not on powershell.exe without Invishell. When any script catch by MDI, use Download Execute Cradles. Use DCSync on DC only, and simple credential dumping on machine after getting NT Authority System. Password extraction from lsass process is definitely helpful, but never ignore creds vaults. I hope you learned something from this review and that these tips help you on your CRTP journey. I wish you the best of luck on your Active Directory penetration testing journey. Lets get connected on LinkedIn, and Feel free to message me on if you have any queries.\nSee you with the next review.

This course covers everything needed to pass the exam. But you may not find it as much interactive as you can expect, as it has lengthy slides to cover most of the topics. The course has the following two sections.\nAndroid \u0026amp; Mobile App Pen testing iOS \u0026amp; Mobile App Pen testing I also went through the TCM Security Mobile Application course for the preparation of this exam.\nExam Info Once you start the exam, you will be given with two android mobile applications with the letter of engagement. This engagement letter outlines the objectives you need to meet to pass the exam. The requirement to pass the exam is to provide a working android mobile application which can exploit both the given applications.\nTimeline I started the exam on 18th May, and I was able to identify the vulnerabilities in the first hour. I spent the first day on analysing the working of both the applications and exploiting these through CLI. The second day I started learning android studio and built a few test android applications. The next day, I built my exploit application which was able to exploit both the given application to perform the required tasks. I tested the built application on different emulators with different API versions as well as on my own mobile phone.\nExam Review The exam was not that much difficult as I was expecting. It was all about understanding the working of the application by reverse engineering it, retrieving data from the application using the provided functionalities and reconstructing another application by reversing the process. By reversing I mean, in some phases you will encounter different situation e.g. encryption, where you will have to reverse the same process to decrypt the given data. In the exam, you will not be asked to get a flag or to root any system, in fact you will get the answers in front of you within a few minutes. The requirement to pass the exam is to provide an application which can exploit those vulnerabilities automatically.\nTips for the Exam: Test the applications on at least one rooted and one non rooted emulator and observe the applications. Understand how Encryption and Hashing can be performed in android applications. Understand Content Providers in android and how these can be exploited. Learn how to build mobile applications with android studio. Learn to analyse the AndroidMenifest.xml file. I wish you the best of luck on your mobile application penetration testing journey.

However, I would say the course has over loaded information, which personally I skipped a lot. It is beneficial for the beginner to understand the concept but that\u0026rsquo;s going to take lot of time. In some places, you will find outdated information in the course, as the course is a little bit older (Thanks to INE that in April they will release new course material for eCPPT). So, Can we see eCPPT V3 soon?\nThe VPN Issue When I started the exam, the VPN was not working. It was giving the following error:\nReducted... failed to negotiate cipher with server Reducted... In the given openvpn configuration file:\nThe following line was there:\ncipher AES-128-CBC The above line was changed as\ndata-ciphers AES-128-CBC This fixed the issues. Further details about the issue can be found here here.\nPreparation: I started the exam on 25 February and submitted the report on 7th march 2024. It took me 12 days to submit the report, because I was also attending my university classes during this time. If you give full time to it, you may finish it earlier. I received the result after a long wait on 27 March 2024. INE has to work to reduce the exam result time. INE should also reduce the long 14 days time of the exam. The reason I have not attempted it for 1 year was lack of time, because I was always busy with work and studies that I was unable to take 15 days break from all that.\nTimeline Day1: In the first day, I was able to pwn one machine. It was very easy and I was happy and confident.\nDay2: I faced issues in setting the pivoting and proxychains during this day, and by the end of the day I was only able to verify that I set up pivoting the right way and all my tools started working again in this environment.\nDay3: I pawned the second machine fairly easily. I tried all what I can to pwn the 3rd machine but I failed, I was thinking it very complex but it was very simple, just lack of post exploitation enumeration.\nDay4: In the first half, I stuck again and at this point, I started worrying. But when I enumerated with focus then I found that I was missing a very simple thing, it was not needing anything extra. I rooted the 3rd machine and also worked on the 4rth one, which was the buffer overflow one.\nDay5: I managed to generate a working exploit for the buffer overflow machine. Note that, whenever you send a long input, the backend application will crash and buffer overflow machine will become unresponsive, you will need to reset the whole exam environment to make it responsive again, in this case make sure to use this tag while generating payload from the msfvenom EXITFUNC=thread. On the same day, I exploited the 5th and last machine as well.\nReporting It is the most important part of the exam. You will not get passing marks if you only show the ways of getting root access across all the machines, but you have to report all the vulnerabilities in each of the machine. I used TCM security report template, which I found to be more beneficial than others. My report was 130 pages long. I have not taken and saved screenshots during the exam, because I started recording using OBS at the start of the exam and saved all the recording with me. I went through all the videos later while preparing the report and took screenshot of the part in the video to add in the report.\nTips for the exam: Work on the pivoting before going to attempt the exam, it is mandatory. Practice the buffer overflows in the windows environment. Get your hands dirty on Metasploit. Specially the post exploitation and routing. Enumerate well in the post exploitation phase. Instead of making screenshot of everything, use OBS to record screen while working. You can use those recorded videos to make screen shots later while reporting.

The password of andre is exposed here. This password is being tried to ssh into the machine but it gave me that the password is incorrect.\nSo, the credentials are being tried at the Gila CMS admin login page. It worked and the admin page is being accessed.\nHere under content\u0026gt;file manager there is an option to upload file. A php reverse shell is being upload here. There\u0026rsquo;s no restriction on file upload.\nThe uploaded file can be accessed in the cmess.thm/assets/revshell.php.\nA reverse shell is being obtained as show below:\nRev shell obtained\nPrivilege Escalation Currently, we are in the machine as www-data user. The linenum.sh is being transferred to the machine and is being run. It gave us a password backup file as shown.\nEscalated to the user andre by running su andre , followed by the found password. As the current shell is not stable, we already got the password of andre, so connected to ssh with the credentials.\nThe user andre is being accessed as shown below:\nGot user access.\nFor getting root, the machine is being explored as the user andre.\nThere is a cronjob running, which is running after each 2 minutes and using wildcard with tar, it can used for getting root.\nThe following command is being run which will create a script that will copy the shell to the temp and will enable its suid bit.\necho \u0026#39;cp /bin/bash /tmp/bash; chmod +s /tmp/bash\u0026#39; \u0026gt; /home/andre/backup/runme.sh A checkpoint file is being created in the folder that will be backed up:\ntouch /home/andre/backup/--checkpoint=1 The following command will execute the script that is copying the shell to /tmp as root.\ntouch /home/andre/backup/--checkpoint-action=exec=sh\\ runme.sh Waited 2 minutes for the script to be executed,, and run the run the copied shell with command /tmp/bash -p\nThe machine is being rooted.\nIn this way, the root access is being obtained.\nConclusion The difficulty level of the machine was medium. The machine contains exposed password of user andre which can be used to access the admin panel. The admin panel has no restriction on file upload, and the files on the server can be run directly. For the privilege escalation, the machine again has exposed password of the user andre, which can be used for accessing the adre user from www-data. The root user can obtained by abusing the cronjobs.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/machine-writeups/cmess-tryhackme/","summary":"Setup The following entry is being added to the /etc/hosts.\n10.10.57.136 cmess.thm Enumeration Nmap all ports scan is being run.

Therefore, I have not enrolled in any additional courses.\nScheduling To schedule the exam, it is required to do so through the Aspen dashboard at least one month in advance.\nExam Day Review In preparation for the exam scheduled at 11 PM, I prioritized getting sufficient rest during the day to ensure a fresh and focused mind. As the exam process began through my dashboard at the designated time, I was prompted with a GoToMeeting link. Realizing I did not have the application installed, I proceeded to download it. To avoid similar issues, I recommend downloading the GoToMeeting application prior to starting the exam. After waiting for approximately 15 minutes with no response, I suspected the proctor may have missed the meeting and reached out to EC Council\u0026rsquo;s live support team. They provided me with an alternative link where the proctor was already waiting. If you experience a similar delay and your proctor has not joined the meeting after 10 to 15 minutes, I advise reaching out to the support team for assistance.\nBefore the exam, the proctor instructed me to enable my microphone, camera, and screen sharing. After following his instructions, he then asked me to show my surroundings to ensure no one was present to provide assistance. Once that was confirmed, he provided all the necessary information to start the exam.\nThe exam consisted of 20 questions and required the use of two browser based machines, a Windows and a Parrot machine.\nInitially, I focused on tasks that were focused on Parrot OS, I discovered all the hosts in the network and did enumeration of all the discovered hosts.\nI shifted to tasks that we can do with Windows after doing all the Linux based tasks. All the questions were very easy.\nThe questions were something like,\nWhat is the ftp password of John? What is the version of SSH? How many Windows machines are there? What is machine IP of windows machine running RDP? The windows based tasks were related to using cryptography, hashing and steganography tools etc. Tools If you want to do preparation for the CEH practical exam, you will need to be proficient in the following tools.\nnmap wireshark John the ripper Cryptool BCTextEditor Veracrypt Openstego Snow Hydra xfreerdp etc Conclusion The certification exam is beginner friendly. If you have the basic understanding of how to use different tools, you can pass the exam easily.\nThank you for taking the time to read this blog. I hope you found it informative and enjoyable.
