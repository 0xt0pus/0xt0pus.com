      <description>A pcap file was being given for analysis.
The pcap file was being opened in the wireshark.
I applied the http filter to filter only http requests.
There was a zip file that was retrieved through http protocol. There was nothing interesting in this zip file.
I moved on, and i found that many requests were being made to the /f_data/data endpoint. All the requests were giving 403 forbidden response except the last one, which gave 200 OK response.</description>
